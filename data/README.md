Place the following dataset to the corresponding folders

Bretaâ€™s data (1)

5000 images
All data owned by Breta01 are available on this link (distributed under the same license as this repository). The data should be placed either in raw/breta/ or processed/breta/ folder according to their location in archive from the link below. (I removed the Czech accents from words. If you want to use them, you have to recover them using CSV files containing: word_without_accents, original_word in UTF-8 encoding.)
